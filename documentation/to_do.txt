Potential and Past Issues:

ADDING A PHYSICS MATERIAL CAUSED THE SIMULATION TO EXPLODE AFTER ABOUT 1000 ITERATIONS!!!
I added a physics material to the LeftCalf and RightCalf, set the static and dynamic coefficients of friction to 100, and the density to PETG.
This caused the simulation to explode after about 1000 iterations, or at least I am 95% sure this was the cause. It no longer happens anymore thank god.

THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH sudo prime-select on-demand !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To Do:

- Video:
    - Start capturing screen video of failures in Isaac Sim as well as shots of code and resulting errors in Isaac Lab.
    - Create a google doc where I can document the flow of my development process so that I don't forget the challenges I faced.

- Design Harold R2:
    - Spherical feet.
    - Switch to robstride actuators.

- Set physics parameters:
    - Friction coefficient.
    - Coefficient of restitution to 0.

- Log various parameters to tensorboard.

- Add in missing reward terms.

- Add noise to observation terms:
    - Orientation.
    - Angular velocities.
    - Joint positions.
    - Joint velocities.
    - Linear velocities.
    - Foot positions.

- Add non-zero angular velocity commands into the training regimen.
    - Modify the heuristic step trajectories by adding and subtracting from L and R velocities according to circles of arc.

- Domain Randomization:
    - Randomize a number of properties.
    - Consider adding domain randomization to the actuator gains instead of joint friction coefficient.
    - Add the option to add a push speed as part of the training curriculum.

- Estimator network:
    - Get rid of the estimator network.

    - He was a prof in the US so should understand English well.

CHANGELOG:
- Copied get_gait_phase() from LimX repo to observations.py.
- Added gait_phase to observations in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Runs with no errors at this point.
- Added proj_gravity as an observation term in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Deleted body_orientation, joint_pos_rel, joint_pos_error, and base_lin_vel as an observation term in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Removed history attribute from joint_vel and actions in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Deleted a number of observation history length variables in harold_cfg.py and replaced them all with one variable, obs_history_length.
- Set all observations to have a history length of obs_history_length in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Added keep_balance, pen_base_height rewards in harold_env_cfg.py.
    - Changed the function for pen_base_height from LimX's custom base_com_height function to the standard base_height_l2 in Isaac Lab.
- Changed std of exp rewards functions to sqrt(0.2) from sqrt(0.25) to match LimX repo in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Added stay_alive_rew_weight=1.0, target_height=0.35, base_height_rew_weight=-20.0 to harold_cfg.py.
- Set z_lin_vel_rew_weight=-0.5, xy_ang_vel_rew_weight=-0.05, flat_body_weight=-10.0 to match LimX repo in harold_cfg.py.
- Removed termination_penalty rewards from harold_env_cfg.py.
- Copied test_gait_reward from LimX repo to rewards in harold_env_cfg.py.
    - Changed contact_forces to contact_forces_ALL to work with existing sensor.
    - Changed "foot_.*" to ["LeftCalf","RightCalf"] to work with our USD file.
- Copied GaitReward() from LimX repo to rewards.py.
- Changed history_length to 4 from 1 for contact_forces_ALL in harold_env_cfg.py to match LimX repo.
- Copied stay_alive() reward function from LimX repo to rewards.py.
- Verified code is working and can train a robot to vaguely stay up for a second or so.
