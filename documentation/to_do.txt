Potential and Past Issues:

ADDING A PHYSICS MATERIAL CAUSED THE SIMULATION TO EXPLODE AFTER ABOUT 1000 ITERATIONS!!!
I added a physics material to the LeftCalf and RightCalf, set the static and dynamic coefficients of friction to 100, and the density to PETG.
This caused the simulation to explode after about 1000 iterations, or at least I am 95% sure this was the cause. It no longer happens anymore thank god.

THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH sudo prime-select on-demand !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To Do:

- Video:
    - Start capturing screen video of failures in Isaac Sim as well as shots of code and resulting errors in Isaac Lab.
    - Create a google doc where I can document the flow of my development process so that I don't forget the challenges I faced.

- Design Harold R2:
    - Spherical feet.
    - Switch to robstride actuators.

- Set physics parameters:
    - Friction coefficient.
    - Coefficient of restitution to 0.

- Log various parameters to tensorboard.

- Add in missing reward terms.

- Add noise to observation terms:
    - Orientation.
    - Angular velocities.
    - Joint positions.
    - Joint velocities.
    - Linear velocities.
    - Foot positions.

- Add non-zero angular velocity commands into the training regimen.
    - Modify the heuristic step trajectories by adding and subtracting from L and R velocities according to circles of arc.

- Domain Randomization:
    - Randomize a number of properties.
    - Consider adding domain randomization to the actuator gains instead of joint friction coefficient.
    - Add the option to add a push speed as part of the training curriculum.

- Estimator network:
    - Get rid of the estimator network.

LimX:
- Wei Zhang, co-founder of LimX dynamics and professor at SUSTech in Shenzhen.
    - He was a prof in the US so should understand English well.

CHANGELOG:
- Saved HAROLD_R1.usd as HAROLD_R1_FLAT.usd (I saved as flattened so it could be modified).
    - I then created a LeftFoot XPrim and RightFoot XPrim (as renamed duplicates of the LeftCalf and RightCalf XPrims).
        - I then deleted the subprims of the left and right feet from LeftCalf and RightCalf and deleted all others than the feet from LeftFoot and RightFoot Xprims.
            - I then created two new fixed joints between the left calf and left foot, and right calf and right foot and made sure that they were in the same level of the hierarchy as the other joints.
- I played around with the new FLAT usd file's robot in Isaac Sim with Shift-Left-Click flinging for a bit and it seems to work OK.
- I then changed harold.py to point to HAROLD_R1_FLAT.usd instead of HAROLD_R1.usd.
- Modified test_gait_reward in harold_env_cfg.py to use "LeftFoot" and "RightFoot" instead of "LeftCalf" and "RightCalf".
- Verified that train.py and play.py run fine with the changes without errors, and physics seems to look ok.
- Trained for about 14 hours in total (~290k steps).
    - First run was 48 minutes.
    - Seconds run was 1 hour 21 minutes.
    - Third run was 12 hours 5 minutes.
    - Each run fine tuned from the best_agent.pt of the previous run.
    - Honestly not terrible but I noticed some weird things going on:
        - It seems to me like it may have been too focused on maintaining an accurate z height and minimizing xy angular velocity that it was forced to speed up and slow down during every step.
            - So that while it did in fact walk in the correct direction and generally reached the required speed, it would slow down during part of every step.
        - I also got the feeling that the Von Mises distribution used by LimX in their GaitReward may have been fighting with the other rewards. Hard to describe.
    - Generated a 4 second video and saved the best_agent.pt.
- Concepts of a plan going forward:
    - Switch to RSL RL to match LimX.
    - Add a dedicated critic network and provide it with priveleged information.
    - Make our code as close to LimX's as possible.
    - Possibly change or get rid of the GaitReward function that LimX used as I have no clue how to go about tuning its values.
